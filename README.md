# MinBoard
MinBoard is a mini 3x3 keyboard that can *literally* fit in your pocket and is a way cheaper option than a streamdeck.
## About The Project
This project was fun to make. It is my first "big" project. It had it's ups and downs, which I liked. In the future I might make another version of the MinBoard but that could happen in the distant future. This project has minimal codind required so if you are not familiar with coding don't worry. I think this would be a fun project for anyone who like diy or fiddeling with tech.
## Components
MinBoard contains 9 keys in total.
