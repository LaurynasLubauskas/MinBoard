## 10/14/2025 - Oct 14th 2025 First Journal, but close to finishing  

I started this project Oct 8th. I already designed the keyboard in KiCad. I have the pcb and the schematics. It is a 3x3 keyboard that you can carry in your pocket **literally** and it uses the seeed xiao RP2040. This keyboard will be connected via USB-C.

I have decided on the switches that i will use the HMX YOGURT LINEAR SWITCH FACTORY LUBED EDITION. I think that it's a great choice. I am still designing the case, but it won't take too long.
