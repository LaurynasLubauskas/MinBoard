## 10/14/2025 - Oct 14th 2025 First Journal, but close to finishing  

I started this project Oct 8th. I already designed the keyboard in KiCad. I have the pcb and the schematics. It is a 3x3 keyboard that you can carry in your pocket **literally** and it uses the seeed xiao RP2040. This keyboard will be connected via USB-C.

I have decided on the switches that i will use the HMX YOGURT LINEAR SWITCH FACTORY LUBED EDITION. I think that it's a great choice. I am still designing the case, but it won't take too long.

## 10/23/2025 - Oct 23rd 2025 Took a break.  

I did a few things since my last journal 9 days ago. They weren't big changes so I didn't think it was worth writing a whole journal update about it. I started on the coding part, it is not easy, but I am managing it. Also since the last journal I updated a few things to the PCB. I added screw hole to the PCB. I'm still looking for a PCB manufacture in Europe so I wouldn't have to wait a long time and spend lots of money on shipping. And in my last journal, I said that I will do the case, but I gave the priority to the code, because I think it's more important.

## 10/26/2025 - Oct 25th 2025 Coding part finished!  

Finally finished the coding part. If you check the repository it looks like I've done nothing, but the for 4 hours I've been working on fixing code so I could flash my MinBoard when I make it. That's it for now. I don't know when I will make the case design for the MinBoard. I got exams and and lots of schoolwork to do so I might even do it next week, or best case scenario I do a little tomorrow and finish it during the week when I am done with my exams and school work. Also I need to do the BOM, but I know the parts I will use so that won't be too hard. That's it for this journal and best case scenario see you next week.
